RVD characterizes riparian vegetation condition for a given stream reach (500 m segment) as the ratio of existing vegetation to an estimation of pre-European settlement vegetation coverage. To numerically calculate condition, native riparian vegetation is coded as ‘1’ and invasive and upland classes are coded as ‘0’in both the existing, and pre-European settlement vegetation rasters and condition is calculated as the ratio of current to historic native riparian coverage for a given reach.

## Output Hierarchy:

VBET produces a polygon shapefile representing the valley bottom associated with the input stream network.  The only attribute of interest is the shape **area**.
