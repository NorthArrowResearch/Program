# Upper Salmon Riverscapes Demo



### Restoration Planning

General Framework of questions 

1) Diagnosis: 

 - Where does current < potential?
- Where are habitat conditions a concern for fish?
- What does the potential condition look like?

2) Why does this condition exist? What's contributing to it? (Do you believe it?)

3) What could be done to improve it? 



HUCs: 

17060203 (Middle Salmon-Panther)

17060204 (Lemhi)

17060202 (Pahsimeroi)

17060201 (Upper Salmon)

### Network

Layers:

- Reach Types and Geomorphic Condition
- RVD
- **
- extrapolated metrics
  - juvenile chinook QRF capacity
  - juvenile NREI capacity (YF)
  - spawner chinook/steelhead FIS capacity
- Temperature (at least one year)
  - min, mean, max 8D
    - display of one 8D value
  - Avg summer (new analysis output)
  - Avg winter (new analysis output)
  - GDD-like to reach a certain point in time, or time to reach a certain GDD equivalent... (new analysis output)
  - Temperature condition (potential-current)


- GPP
- RCA
- Rosgen Reach Types
- VBET
- Confinement
- Sinuosity, Planform and Braidedness
- GRTS


- *extrapolated champ metrics for Lemhi and Yankee Fork (display a few for context)*

- GAA (display a few)

  - mean annual flow, catchment size

- *hydrography (perennial)--use a metric file for base? e.g. confinement? (context)*

- *solar (context)*

- *conductivity (context)*

- *Fish data?*

  ​

### Sites 

(5 example sites in Riverscapes (all visits to each site), preferably some BACI on restoration or with potential for restoration)

- chinook juvenile habitat capacity (QRF)

- juvenile habitat capacity (NREI)

- spawner habitat capacity (FIS)

- *hydraulic model (context and input)*

- *topo surveys (context)*

- *aux measurements (context)*

  ​

### Network Context layers (not currently part of projects)

- Western US states
- ICRB outline
- HUC4s
- ESU populations 
- Fish distributions (streamnet) or IP
- Dams
- Cities
- Roads
- Aerial imagery
- land ownership
- ecoregions
- rkms (Upper Salmon?)

- hillshades (general context for non-VBET areas)

- Valley breaks (BOR)
