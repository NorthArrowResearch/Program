Later on we may start serving it from a QGis plugin repository but for now, in order to use the latest version of the plugin you will need to pull it from github. 

## First Time Clone

Go to the [github page](https://github.com/Riverscapes/analyst-toolbar-qgis-plugin) and grab the cloning address: `git@github.com:Riverscapes/analyst-toolbar-qgis-plugin.git`

In your favourite tool clone the repo. Make ***SURE*** to clone it to the right place. 

### On windows:

```
c:\users\YOURNAME\.qgis\python\plugins\analyst-toolbar-qgis-plugin
```

### On OSX:

```
/Users/YOURNAME/.qgis2/python/plugins/analyst-toolbar-qgis-plugin
```

Now you should be able to load the plugin in QGIS.
